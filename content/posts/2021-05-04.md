                "Tell all the truth but tell it slant —<br>
                Success in Circuit lies<br>
                Too bright for our infirm Delight<br>
                The Truth's superb surprise<br>
                As Lightning to the Children eased<br>
                With explanation kind<br>
                The Truth must dazzle gradually<br>
                Or every man be blind —"
